Silver Market Forecast Analysis

An Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Study

Project Submission – Data & Business Analysis

1. Introduction

This project presents a structured Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of a Silver market forecasting dataset sourced from Kaggle. The study aims to examine historical price movements, identify volatility patterns, and interpret forecast trends from both analytical and business perspectives.

The analysis simulates the role of a Data & Business Analyst, integrating technical data examination with strategic decision-making insights.

2. Objective of the Study

The primary objectives of this project are:

To analyze historical silver price trends

To identify volatility patterns in the market

To evaluate forecast stability

To interpret market behavior from a business perspective

To generate decision-support insights based on data

3. Dataset Description

Source: Kaggle

File Used: Cleaned_Silver_Forecast_2026.csv

Domain: Commodity & Financial Market Analysis

Data Type: Time-Series Structured Dataset

The dataset consists of historical silver price records and forecast-related variables prepared for trend and volatility evaluation.

4. Methodology

The project followed a systematic analytical approach:

4.1 Data Preparation

Checked for missing or inconsistent values

Standardized date formats for time-series analysis

Verified data types

Sorted records chronologically

Ensured dataset integrity before analysis

This step ensured the accuracy and reliability of subsequent analysis.

4.2 Exploratory Data Analysis

The following analytical techniques were applied:

Trend Analysis: To identify upward and downward price movements

Volatility Assessment: To detect unstable market periods

Rolling Average Analysis: To smooth short-term fluctuations

High–Low Spread Evaluation: To measure price range variations

Forecast Comparison: To assess alignment between historical and predicted trends

4.3 Business Interpretation

Beyond technical analysis, the results were interpreted in a business context to:

Identify potential risk exposure periods

Understand momentum shifts

Evaluate forecast reliability

Support strategic investment planning

5. Key Findings

The analysis revealed:

Identifiable cyclical patterns in silver price movement

Periods of increased volatility indicating higher market risk

Momentum shifts between bullish and bearish trends

Forecast trends showing dependency on historical momentum stability

These findings highlight the importance of volatility monitoring and trend analysis in financial decision-making.

6. Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

The following analytical indicators were developed:

Overall Trend Direction

Volatility Range

Average Price Movement

High–Low Spread

Forecast Stability Indicator

Risk Exposure Period Identification
